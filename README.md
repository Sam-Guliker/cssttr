## Week 3.
In week 3 was looking for some nice UX animations. With the animations I want to help the user on the page.

## What did I learn?
There is alot more to learn from CSS. I'm talking about the different pseudo classes and how to target your HTML elements.
Its also alot of fun to play with animations to see where the limits are.
