## Week 1.
Done some research for accesibility, and made a design for the assignment.

## Week 2.
In week 2 I focussed on the components of the web page. I also brought some CSS in place.

## Week 3.
In week 3 was looking for some nice UX animations. With the animations I want to help the user on the page.
